# Day 1 - Setup


## Central ideia

It was mostly environment setup, course and tech stack presentation.


## Key points

- Create project using RESTful API structure
    - Consume same data source with front-end and mobile app 
- Install node using distro package manager
    + Installed it using `nvm` on w10
- Install vscode using chocolatey
    + Imported saved configs from last setup (dracula, material-icons, mapviewer, rainbow-brackets, editorconfig, etc)
- Install `json-viewer` chrome extension
    + Maybe search for firefox equivalent before charging browsers?
- Start project folder bootstrap
    + back-end: `server` folder, as a "node" project
    + front-end: `web` folder, react project generated with `create-react-app`
- Using `typescript` both on server and web
    + Provides type-check for javascript
    + Superset on javascript
- React
    + Provides componentization, separation of concerns, maintenability and organization of complex SPAs (single page applications)
- Explanation on why develop React Native using Expo
    + Low barrier for entry developers (simple environment setup)
    + Doesn't require SDK setup (i.e. ios requires apple env)
